Stream pipelines

- Streams are not data containers, they provided operations over elements but cannot be used to contain objects.
- Stream are compose by a source, zero or more intermediate operations and a terminal operation.

- Source: Which we generate the stream such as collection. (Array, generation function or io channel).
- Intermediate operations: These are operations that are applied on a stream and they return another stream.
- Terminal Operation: Produces a result or side effect from stream, (Side effect is anything other than returning
the result, such as print statement)

- A chain of operations over a stream are called a stream pipeline, an is composed by three things:
    Source
    Zero or more intermediate operations
    A terminal Operations

- Streams are not data containers
- Streams are inmutable
- We can use streams only once
