Collectors
- Collectors let us to decrease time collecting something
- There are collectors for list, set, or any type of collections
- Collect is a terminal operation
- Collectors provide ready made reduce algorithms
- There are summarize and aggregate operations with collectors

we can transform stream to collection with collector, some of that collections are:
    list
    set
    queue
    three set
    Map

An important characteristic is we can divide into two collectors a stream based on a condition true or false.
Also we can divide a stream in others stream based on a specific condition
we can chain collector as an argument of other grouping operation on collectors, this is also known as downstream

Collectors has operations
    Joining Lets us to join string or values to produce a string, not a List
