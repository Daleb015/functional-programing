Functional Interfaces

* Functional interfaces are behind every lambda
* can only have one abstract method
* Every interface with just one abstract method
 is a functional interface
* This has made in this way because this allows no ambiguity
* We can use @Functional interface to restrict nobody add a
second abstract method, but is not needed.
* Cannot be lambdas without functional interface, whe can design our own interface,
 but java api has implementations of these funtional interfaces
