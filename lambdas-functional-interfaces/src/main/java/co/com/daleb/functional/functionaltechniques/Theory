There are a few techniques in functional programming:

- Functional Chaining
- Functiona composition
- Closures
- Currying
- Lazy evaluation
- Tail Call Optiomization


                                                            Functional Chaining

In this technique we chains functions, each method returns an object allowing the calls to be chaines together in a
single statement avoiding store intermediate results.

obj.function1().function2().function3()

it will express like this

obj.performThis().andThenThis().andThenThis()..

To use this we are going to take help from the interfaceÂ´s default methods.

to chain functions we should use the default method and execute in like a method that return a function.

Is important to know that function interface has the default method to do theses.
